## 2. Background

### What is it about?

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction project leverages historical booking data to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled. the dataset contains various features related to bookings. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model for accurate predictions to assist hotel managers in inventory management and pricing strategies. The project will involve data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and deployment. The project aims to improve hotel revenue, reduce operational costs, and enhance customer satisfaction despite the challenges of imbalanced data, missing values, and model integration.

### Why does it matter?

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction project matters because it helps hotels optimize revenue, manage room inventory, improve customer service, and make informed strategic decisions. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can adjust pricing, accommodate guests during peak periods, enhance customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage. This project is crucial for reducing financial impact and improving overall business outcomes in the highly competitive hospitality industry.

### What are your reasearch questions?

What features in the booking data are the most significant predictors of booking cancellations?

How does the performance of the cancellation prediction model vary across different hotels or hotel chains?

Can the model's predictions be used to optimize pricing strategies and improve revenue management?

* Which variable/column will be your target/label in your ML model?

In the Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction project, the target variable (also known as the label) will be the is_canceled column. This binary variable indicates whether a booking was canceled (1) or not (0). The goal of the machine learning model will be to predict this variable based on the other features in the dataset.

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 4.1 Data Cleaning

### 4.1.1 Checking and removing duplicates from the Data Set

* Checking the duplicates from the data set 

### 4.1.2 Analysing the data and visualization

* This plot is designed to show the relationship between two variables: whether a hotel booking was canceled (is_canceled) and whether the guest who made the booking is a repeated guest (is_repeated_guest).
* The is_canceled column likely contains binary values (0 or 1) indicating whether each booking was canceled or not, and the is_repeated_guest column also likely contains binary values indicating whether each guest is a repeated guest or not.
* The bars in the plot represent the frequency of each combination of is_canceled and is_repeated_guest values in the data.

# 5. Feature selection methods

## 5.1 Univariate feature selection

* Features in matrix X are scaled using Min-Max scaling with MinMaxScaler().
* Utilizing SelectKBest with chi-squared (chi2) scoring, the code conducts independent feature selection based on significance to the target variable y.
* Feature scores and names are stored in dfscores and dfcolumns DataFrames, concatenated into featureScores for streamlined analysis.
* The nlargest() method extracts and prints the top 10 features by chi-squared scores, providing a concise summary.
* The printed DataFrame with 'columns' and 'Score' aids in identifying influential variables for subsequent modeling. Univariate selection simplifies models and boosts predictive performance by focusing on key features.

## 5.2 Correlation matrix with heatmap

* The image computes a correlation matrix (data_corr) for the hotel_data, revealing relationships between variables.
* A 12x9-inch heatmap is created using seaborn (sns.heatmap()) with the "RdYlGn" color map, visually representing the correlations.
* The resulting heatmap is displayed using plt.show(), offering an intuitive overview of the dataset's correlation structure.

## 5.3 Top Features

* The code defines top_n as the number of features to display and extracts the top N important features using nlargest() on feat_importances.
* A horizontal bar graph is created using top_features.plot(kind='barh') for visualizing the importance scores of the selected features.
* The resulting bar graph is shown with plt.show(), offering a concise visual summary of the top features.

## Conclusions:

Cancellation count is less for repeated guests

Lead time is less for confirm bookings lead time is less for resort hotels

Stay in weekend nights is equal for both confirm and cancelled cases in both the hotels but the outliers are high in confirmed classes

Distribution of total special requests is left skewed

Lead time is high for room types C,A and D for both the hotels

Deposit type is refundable waiting list days are same but the other categories it is high.

Logistic Regression demonstrated the highest overall performance with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score among the three classifiers.

Decision Tree exhibited slightly lower performance compared to Logistic Regression but still provided reasonable accuracy and balanced precision and recall.

Random Forest showed competitive results, balancing precision and recall, providing a good trade-off between the two.
